# AWS Encryption SDK for Javascript Node.js examples

This repository holds examples for encrypt and decrypt in Node.js.
These examples are intended to work so you can experiment with functional code.

# NOTE
The CMK's in these examples *are only* for example.  They *are public*.
Replace these CMK's with your own.

## KMS Simple

This is the simples example.
It encrypts and decrypts a simple string with KMS.

## KMS Stream

An example of encrypting a file stream with KMS.

## KMS Regional Discovery

KMS Keyrings can be put in `discovery` mode.
This means that it will attempt to connect to any region.
This is not always what you want.
Perhapses for performance you want to limit attempts to a set of "close" regions.
Perhapses for policy reason you want to exclude some regions.

## RSA Simple

Sometimes you may want to use an RSA key to exchange secrets.
This has some advantages, but comes with a heaved key management cost.
If you can use KMS, the context guaranties are generally worth it.
However, I still want to provide an example incase this fits your use case.
