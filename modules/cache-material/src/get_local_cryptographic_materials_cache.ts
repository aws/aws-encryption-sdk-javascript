   * This is not a good idea for cryptographic uses.
   * Also, this lets customers create
   * a null cache for testing purposes.
   *
   * If capacity is 0
   * then I use the `length` option

   *
   * The `length` option is used
   * to deal with managing
   * the size of the LRU
   * when items may be larger than 1.
   * Large buffers or strings
   * are good examples.

   * By forcing the length of every

   *
   * To be clear, as an example say I add 9 items at T=0.
   * If the MaxAge is 60 minutes, and at T=59 I add a 10th item.
   * Then get each of the other 9 items.
   * Now, at T=60, `mayEvictTail` will check the age of the tail
   * and not evict it because the item has not aged out.
