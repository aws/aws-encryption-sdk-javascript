/* oaepHash support was added in Node.js v12.9.1 (https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/28335)
 * However, the integration tests need to be able to verify functionality on other versions.
 * There are no constants to sniff,
 * and looking at the version would not catch back-ports.
 * So I simply try the function.
 * However there is a rub as the test might seem backwards.
 * Sending an invalid hash to the version that supports oaepHash will throw an error.
 * But sending an invalid hash to a version that does not support oaepHash will be ignored.
