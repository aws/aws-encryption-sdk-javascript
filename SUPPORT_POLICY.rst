Overview
========
This page describes the support policy for the AWS Encryption SDK. We regularly provide the AWS Encryption SDK with updates that may contain support for new or updated APIs, new features, enhancements, bug fixes, security patches, or documentation updates. Updates may also address changes with dependencies, language runtimes, and operating systems.

We recommend users to stay up-to-date with Encryption SDK releases to keep up with the latest features, security updates, and underlying dependencies. Continued use of an unsupported SDK version is not recommended and is done at the userâ€™s discretion.


Major Version Lifecycle
========================
The AWS Encryption SDK follows the same major version lifecycle as the AWS SDK. For details on this lifecycle, see  `AWS SDKs and Tools Maintenance Policy`_.
